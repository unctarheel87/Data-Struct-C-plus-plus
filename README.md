# Data-Struct-C-plus-plus

* This project implements standard data structures in `c++`.

* The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of classic CS data structures, while learning some basics around `c++` syntax, memory management and best practices.

## Data Structures so far
* Binary Search Tree - `insert(val)`, `find(val)`, and `validate()` member functions.
