# Data-Struct-C-plus-plus

* This project implements standard data structures in `c++`.

* The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of classic CS data structures, while learning some basics around `c++` syntax, memory management and best practices.

## Data Structures so far
* __Binary Search Tree__ - `insert(val)`, `find(val)`, and `validate()` member functions.
* __Linked List__ 
* __Hash Table__ - `set(key, value)`, `get(key)`
